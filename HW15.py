#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.

for a in range(5,0,-1):
    print(a)
else:
    print("print hello world")

#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.

for b in range(0,31,2):
    print(b)

#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.

for c in range(1,31,):

    if(c%3==0):
        continue
    else :
        print(c)
#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.

animals=[ "dog","hydrozoa","kangaroo","red panda","weasel"]
for d in animals:
    print(d)

#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
for e in input("give me a word")[::-1]:
    print(e)

#6.Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
numbers=[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
for f in numbers:
    print(f)

#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers: int=0
oddNumbers=0
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.
for g in numbers:
    if g%2==0:
        evenNumbers+=1
    else:
            oddNumbers+=1
print(evenNumbers)
print(oddNumbers)

#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
h= input("integer")
i=0
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for i in range(1,int(h)):
    h*=i
print(h)
